## Case Study 1

![roulette](/img/roulette.png)

1. We will bet on a number between 1 and 36 (simulating the numbers present on the roulette wheel, ignoring the color).
   
2. For real heads bet, we win 36 back if the ball lands on our number (35 from the other participants and our 1 real back).
   
3. If the ball lands on another number, we lose the money we bet.
